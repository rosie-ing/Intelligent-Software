We are the lanterns that burn in the lighthouse, the candles in the crypt. We are the light. Let there be light. This is a war and we must be the victors. There's too much to lose if we fail. We'll cross the seas like a band of crusaders, searching for some precious grail. We are the embers that glow in the winter, the diamonds in the mine. Let's take our torches and pray God will show us a sign. Deep in the darkness night, when there's a spark of hope, we must be points of light. He's in the darkness, bright as the dazzling stars in a different sky. And in our cruelest hour, when hope is gone, we'll raise our heads and we'll journey on. When the great battle commences, surely the light will prevail. We will break down his defenses, he will fall. And the sun will rise. Deep in the darkness night, when there's a spark of hope, we must be points of light. He's in the darkness, bright as the dazzling stars in a different sky.
